# Frozen Planetoid

Frozen Planetoid can generate static sites that aggregate the content of multiple websites through their RSS feed.

For example, [this is a couple of tech blogs I follow](https://alexpdp7.github.io/frozenplanetoid/tech.html).

Because Frozen Planetoid generates static sites, you can host Frozen Planetoid with services such as GitHub Pages, or basic web hosting.

You can use Frozen Planetoid:

* ... as a low cost RSS feed reader
* ... to promote websites that provide good RSS feeds
